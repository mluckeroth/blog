## Data Science and Machine Learning

### Exploritory Data Analysis - Forest Cover Classification (Part 1)

[__Project Notebook__](/project_1/)

This notebook covers basic exploritory data analysis for the [Forest Cover Type Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-kernels-only) dataset.  The goal is to familiarize the analyst with the data, determine features that have most influnce on predictor, prepare data for modeling, and inform analyst on the best starting point for modeling.


### Feature Engineering - Forest Cover Classification (Part 2)

[__Project Notebook__](/project_2/)

This project covers basic classification modeling and optimization based on feature engineering for the [Forest Cover Type Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-kernels-only) dataset.  The goal is to prepare data for modeling by enhancing the feature set with contrived attributes that improve predictive accuracy of basic Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine models.


### Ensemble Modeling - Forest Cover Classification (Part 3)

[__Project Notebook__](/project_3/)

This project covers development and hyper parameter tuning of an ensemble classification model for the [Forest Cover Type Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-kernels-only) dataset.  The goal is to build and optimized a series of standard classification models and combine them in a voting ensemble to classify the forest cover type for submission to the Kaggle Competition.
